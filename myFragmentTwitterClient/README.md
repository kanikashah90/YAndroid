# My Simple Twitter Client

This is the 3rd week project that implements a simple twitter client.
The following user stories are implemented:

* [x] User can sign in to Twitter using OAuth login
* [x] User can view the tweets from their home timeline
* [x] User is displayed the username, name, and body for each tweet
* [x] User is displayed the relative timestamp for each tweet "8m", "7h"
* [x] User can view more tweets as they scroll with infinite pagination
* [x] User can compose a new tweet
* [x] User can click a ?Compose? icon in the Action Bar on the top right
* [x] User can then enter a new tweet and post this to twitter
* [x] User is taken back to home timeline with new tweet visible in timeline
* [x] User can refresh tweets timeline by pulling down to refresh (i.e pull-to-refresh)


Time spent: about 8 hours for developing  the app.
