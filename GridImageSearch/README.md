# Simple Grid Image Search

This is simple instagram client that downloads and shows the most popular photos in Instagram.

The following required information are represented:

* [x] Required: The username 
* [x] Required: The image 
* [x] Requited: The caption of the image


Time spent: about 5 hours for developing  the app.

Unfortunately at the moment the instagram API is not responding and I get timeout exception for my request. So I don't have an interface from my app to capture. I'll capture the GIF and update this readme as soon as I'm able to get response.
